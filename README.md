**HEART DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING**  
This project presents a performance analysis of various machine learning (ML) techniques, including k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, logistic regression, and support vector machine (SVM), for predicting heart disease. The dataset used for training and evaluation is collected from the Kaggle website and includes patient information with over 14 attributes.   
**Data Collection:** Download the dataset from the Kaggle website or use the provided dataset.   
**Data Processing:** Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables if necessary.   
**Split Data:** Split the dataset into training data and test data using appropriate techniques such as train-test split.    
**Model Training:** Train the machine learning models (logistic regression, SVM, k-nearest neighbor, decision tree) using the training data.    
**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained models using both training and test data to predict accuracy and select the best-performing model.
